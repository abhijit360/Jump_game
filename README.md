Player jumps on a platform to climb up. An infinite upward climb. There is a downward gravity. If the player remains to
long on each of the platforms, the platform will collapse and the player will fall. The high score would be displaced by
a line that cuts the screen.

Progress measured as distance travelled by the player( in pixels?). At fixed distance intervals, there will be moving
platforms. Enemies that will reduce your jump height (one hit) [if skill permits, reduce visibility] and kill you (second hit).
There will be power ups such as increased jump height, eliminate aliens for a time period/ distance travelled, increase
platform size, decrease effect of gravity.

Things to code:
player mechanics: jumping, constant gravity,
collision mechanics: collision with player and platform , collision with enemy (hit counter and time duration
between hits)
platform mechanics: randomly producing platforms, timer for collapsing , movement mechanics at higher levels
enemy mechanics: movement mechanics ( stationary or moving horizontally/ vertically), collision with player
power up: spawning mechanics, moving power up?, effect showcased through sprite design.

initially work with rectangles and blocks. Add animated sprites later once game mechanism and idea is in place.

Animated sprite:
player: moving left/right, jumping, falling
enemy: moving left/right, stationary twitch.
platform: collapsing, larger platforms,

final goals:
learn a bit of swift to get this game running on the app store
